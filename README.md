This is simple KNN algorithm for diabetes prediction. Can be reworked to for other predictions. Reading and spliting data is done 80/20 for every file. CSV has to have classifier at last position. Accuracy for diabetes is 76/77% because of noisy data. Program can handle larger databases (30000) tested.
